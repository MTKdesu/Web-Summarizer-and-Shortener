## Description
Web Summarizer and Shortener is a tool designed to create summaries and short links for web content. It takes a URL of a webpage or a YouTube video as an input and returns a summary and a shortened URL. This tool offers both free and pro features.

The free features include **Short Link Creation**, where you can generate short, manageable links from lengthy URLs, and **Summarization**, which utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize the content of a given web URL.

The pro features offer more advanced functionalities such as **Custom Summarization Levels**, where you can customize the level of detail in your summaries, **Social Media Integration** for seamless sharing of summaries and short links through Google and Facebook authentication, **API Access** to integrate our services into your applications or workflows, and a **User Dashboard** for registered users to track their activity, manage links, and customize settings.
